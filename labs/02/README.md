# Open Data

> [!NOTE]
> In this lab, you will practice exploring and extending an open dataset, documenting it, and reflecting on its quality and usability. The goal is to learn how open data can be used, combined, and evaluated according to best practices.

**1.	Select a Dataset**  
Choose an openly available dataset from a trusted source (examples for data sources are given in the lecture slides and here: https://github.com/irgroup-classrooms/awesome-data-modeling). Make sure the dataset is downloadable and accessible in a common format.

**2.	Describe the Dataset**  
In your documentation, provide the following details (also think about additional criteria):
  - Title & Source (where you found it)
  - File Format(s)
  - Size (rows, columns, or file size)
  - Basic statistics (e.g., ranges, averages, min/max for numeric columns)
  - Geographic or temporal coverage (e.g., “Covers traffic data in New York, 2015–2023”)
  - License (Is it open? What are the conditions for reuse?)

**3.	Augment the Dataset**  
Identify at least one other open dataset on the web or web data (e.g., a Wikipedia page) that could be combined with your chosen dataset and briefly explain:  
  - How the two datasets could be linked or compared.
  - What kinds of research questions could be answered by combining them.
  - What kinds of next steps would be necessary to merge the datasets?

**4.	Review the Dataset Using FAIR Principles**  
Assess how well the dataset follows the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). You can find more details about the criteria in the lecture slides. Please answer the following questions:
  - Findable: Is the dataset easy to locate with sufficient metadata?
  - Accessible: Can anyone download it without barriers?
  - Interoperable: Is it provided in a machine-readable, standard format?
  - Reusable: Is the license clear, and is the documentation sufficient for reuse?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Finally, add a Markdown-formatted file (`dataset.md`) containing the dataset description, augmentation ideas and potential research questions, and the FAIR review to the lab repository. Please use a clear structure (headings, bullet points, tables where appropriate).
